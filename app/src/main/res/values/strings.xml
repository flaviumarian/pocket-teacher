    <!-- Privacy Policy -->
    <string name="privacy_policy_1">Privacy policy</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_2">This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Mobile Application Developer ("Mobile Application Developer", "we", "us" or "our") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in the Pocket Teacher mobile application and any of its products or services (collectively, "Mobile Application" or "Services").

It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_3">Automatic collection of information</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_4">Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Mobile Application or Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Mobile Application traffic and usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_5">Collection of personal information</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_6">You can visit the Mobile Application without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Mobile Application\'s features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content, or fill any online forms in the Mobile Application. When required, this information may include the following:

Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
Contact information such as email address, address, etc.
Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.
Certain features on the mobile device such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc.
You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Mobile Application\'s features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_7">Managing personal information</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_8">You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Mobile Application or Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so on the settings page of your account in the Mobile Application.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_9">Storing personal information</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_10">We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_11">Use and processing of collected information</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_12">In order to make our Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you via our Mobile Application. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources.

This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_13">Information transfer and storage</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_14">Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own.

    <string name="privacy_policy_15">The rights of users</string>

    <string name="privacy_policy_17">The right to object to processing</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_18">Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</string>

To obtain this information please contact us.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_23">Privacy of children</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_24">We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children\'s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through our Mobile Application or Service without their permission.

    <string name="privacy_policy_29">Data breach</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_30">In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application has been compromised or users Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.

When we do, we will post a notice in the Mobile Application, send you an email.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_31">Legal disclosure</string>
