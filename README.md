# Pocket Teacher
The main goal of this project and research has been to study and analyze the existing technologies to facilitate the implementation of a modern mobile platform. This type of application ensures a bridge between two fundamental categories of people from within the educational environment. As a result of studying the approaches used by various large applications, the paper contains theoretical aspects that introduce the crucial elements and concepts needed for the successful planning and development of the project. There is a significant emphasis on the development of each component, as well as the final approach that led to achieving all the objectives presented. The focus of the implementation process is to apply all available knowledge starting from initial designs, the needed network configurations, to building the application. Prioritizing the separation of the two user account types, namely the teachers and the students, was a fundamental aspect. The final result fulfills all initial expectations, being an easy-to-use platform that targets the broad audience from the educational domain. Due to the information obtained throughout the university years and other experiences that came alongside it, this in depth presentation is seen as a personal achievement to my collegiate career.
